# Ansible Execution Environments

This repo contains the definitions for Ansible Execution Environments (EE) that
I use.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repo are welcomed. New directories must follow the format
that `ansible-builder` expects.
The name given to the directory should match the name of the EE image.
